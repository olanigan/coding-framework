End the current development session with comprehensive delivery documentation and retrospective analysis.

## Session Completion Process:

1. **Verify Active Session**: Check `sessions/.current-session` for the active session
2. **No Active Session**: If none exists, inform user there's nothing to end
3. **Session Exists**: Generate comprehensive session completion documentation

4. **Post-Completion Actions**:
   - Clear `sessions/.current-session` file (don't remove, just empty)
   - Generate any required delivery documentation
   - Update project documentation if needed
   - Create follow-up tasks if session was incomplete

5. **Integration with Delivery Pipeline**:
   - Reference `/project:session-delivery` for formal delivery docs
   - Prepare retrospective data for sprint reviews
   - Update project backlog with lessons learned

6. **Quality Assurance Check**:
   - Verify all acceptance criteria are documented
   - Ensure knowledge transfer completeness
   - Confirm future developer can continue work

The documentation should be comprehensive enough that another developer or AI can:
- Understand what was accomplished
- Continue the work where it left off
- Learn from the problems encountered
- Apply the lessons learned to future work
- Assess the impact on the larger project

## Final Confirmation:
Inform user that the session has been comprehensively documented and remind them:
- Session is now closed and documented
- Documentation is available for future reference
- Use `/project:session-list` to view all sessions
- Use `/project:session-start` to begin new work
