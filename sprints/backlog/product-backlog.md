## Prioritization Framework

### MoSCoW Method
- **Must Have**: Critical for launch/release
- **Should Have**: Important but not critical
- **Could Have**: Desirable but not necessary
- **Won't Have**: Out of scope for current phase

### Value vs Effort Matrix
```
High Value, Low Effort    | High Value, High Effort
(Quick Wins) üéØ          | (Major Features) üèîÔ∏è
-------------------------|-------------------------
Low Value, Low Effort    | Low Value, High Effort
(Fill-ins) üì¶           | (Avoid/Defer) ‚ùå
```

### Prioritization Criteria
1. **Business Value**: Revenue impact, user satisfaction
2. **Technical Risk**: Implementation complexity, unknowns
3. **Dependencies**: Blocking other features or teams
4. **Compliance**: Legal or regulatory requirements
5. **Performance**: System stability and speed
