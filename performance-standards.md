# Performance Standards - SDLC Framework v1.0

**Last Updated**: July 1, 2025  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Compliance**: Mandatory for all development work

## Overview
Performance-first development is a core principle of SDLC v1.0. All development work must meet these standards before being considered complete. These standards are based on lessons learned from the workerHalal project and modern web performance best practices.

## Core Performance Principles

### 1. Performance Budget Approach
- Every feature must have defined performance budgets before development begins
- Performance cannot be "optimized later" - it must be built in from day one
- Performance regressions block deployment to production

### 2. Measurement-Driven Development
- All performance claims must be backed by measurements
- Before/after metrics required for all performance-related changes
- Real User Monitoring (RUM) data takes precedence over synthetic testing

### 3. User-Centric Metrics
- Focus on metrics that directly impact user experience
- Business impact metrics (conversion, engagement) tracked alongside technical metrics
- Mobile and slow connection performance given equal priority to desktop

- Use appropriate data types and constraints
- Implement caching strategies for frequently-accessed data
- Monitor and optimize slow queries regularly

### API Optimization

- Implement response compression (gzip/brotli)
- Use pagination for large datasets
- Implement field selection to reduce payload size
- Cache frequently-requested data

#### Request Optimization
- Minimize HTTP requests through batching
- Use CDN for static assets
- Implement proper caching headers
- Optimize serialization/deserialization

### Frontend Optimization
#### JavaScript Optimization
- Implement code splitting and lazy loading
- Use tree shaking to eliminate dead code
- Optimize bundle size with webpack-bundle-analyzer
- Implement service workers for caching

#### Rendering Optimization
- Use React.memo() and useMemo() appropriately
- Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
- Optimize image loading with lazy loading and responsive images
- Minimize layout shifts and reflows

#### CSS Optimization
- Use CSS-in-JS efficiently or optimize CSS delivery
- Eliminate unused CSS
- Use critical CSS inlining for above-the-fold content
- Optimize font loading strategies

## Performance Monitoring & Alerting

### Real User Monitoring (RUM)
```javascript
// Example RUM implementation
const performanceObserver = new PerformanceObserver((list) => {
  for (const entry of list.getEntries()) {
    // Send performance metrics to monitoring service
    analytics.track('performance_metric', {
      metric: entry.name,
      value: entry.value,
      timestamp: Date.now()
    });
  }
});

performanceObserver.observe({ entryTypes: ['navigation', 'paint', 'largest-contentful-paint'] });
```

### Performance Alerts Configuration
- **Critical Alerts**: API response time > 1 second
- **Warning Alerts**: Page load time > 3 seconds
- **Info Alerts**: Performance score drop > 10 points

### Monitoring Dashboards
- Real-time performance metrics dashboard
- Historical performance trends
- Performance comparison across environments
- User experience impact metrics

## Performance Budget Management

### Setting Performance Budgets
1. **Baseline Measurement**: Measure current performance
2. **Target Definition**: Set specific, measurable targets
3. **Budget Allocation**: Allocate performance budget across features
4. **Monitoring Setup**: Implement continuous monitoring

### Budget Enforcement
- Performance budgets are enforced in CI/CD pipeline
- Builds fail if performance budgets are exceeded
- Performance regression blocks deployment
- Regular budget reviews and adjustments

### Example Performance Budget
```json
{
  "performance_budget": {
    "api_response_time": "500ms",
    "page_load_time": "2000ms",
    "bundle_size": "1000kb",
    "lighthouse_performance": 90,
    "core_web_vitals": {
      "lcp": "2500ms",
      "fid": "100ms",
      "cls": "0.1"
    }
  }
}
```
